# Kubernetes For Developers Simplified Class Diagram

This class diagram contains the main concepts needed from a developer perspective.

Warning: this class diagram is far from exhaustive ! In addition, it sometimes contains some adaptations for a better readability, like regrouping concepts in a parent class, event if not done in Kubernetes reference.
Finally, it mixes the concepts of specifications and objects: specifications are reproduced as class attributes directly on the same class representing the runtime objects. Note that main concept classes inherit the K8SObject class.
